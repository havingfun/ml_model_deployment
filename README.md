# ml_model_deployment
Repo of repeatable ML model pipeline development and deployment

## Machine Learning Pipeline: Overview

### Steps:
1. Data Gathering
2. Data Analysis
3. Data Pre-processing
4. Feature Engineering
5. Feature Selection
6. ML Model Building
7. ML Model Assessment - evaluate **uplift in business value** in addition to ROC-AUC, MSE, MAE, etc. metrics
8. Model Pipeline Deployment - includes Feature Engineering, Feature Selection, and ML Model components (not just the ML Model)
