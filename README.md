# ml_model_deployment
Repo of repeatable ML model pipeline development and deployment

## Machine Learning Pipeline: Overview

### Steps:
1. Data Gathering
2. Data Analysi
3. Feature Engineering - deal with missing data, convert categorical variables, assess data distributions, and deal with outliers
4. Feature Selection
5. ML Model Building
6. ML Model Assessment - evaluate **uplift in business value** in addition to ROC-AUC, MSE, MAE, etc. metrics
7. Model Pipeline Deployment - includes Feature Engineering, Feature Selection, and ML Model components (not just the ML Model)
